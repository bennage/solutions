# Solution Architecture: Simple Digital Marketing Website

Your simple digital marketing website will be built from multiple Azure services, and you have some technology decisions to make and some considerations to be aware of.

First, regardless of the web framework you choose, you have to decide how you're going to host it: either using Paas (platform-as-a-service) or IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service). Read about each of these hosting approaches in the "host your digital marketing website" node in the table of contents to the left. The documentation describes each approach and even include templates to deploy fully working architectures to Azure.

Next, you'll have to decide what web framework to use. This decision will influence which technologies you use to build your digital marketing website - what type of data storage, what type of data analytics, and what type of application lifecycle management. Read about each of these in the "create your digital marketing website" node in the table of contents to the left. 

Once you've created your website, decided how you'll manage the website's lifecycle, and started writing code you will want to make sure your website takes advantage of everything Azure has to offer. Azure provides the tools to make your website resilient, secure, and  automatically scale to meet customer demand. Read about how to accomplish this in the "take advantage of Azure strengths" node in the table of contents to the left.
